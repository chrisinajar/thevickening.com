          Hi, I'm Chris. I do things, I like stuff. There are genres of music I like more than others. I spend a lot of time on the computer, and occasionally that time is productive. Not only did I somehow convince this southern belle to marry me, but I also wrote this website, aren't you impressed?

          Hullo! I'm Kayla! A lover of inappropriate jokes, you can usually find me trying to make a room laugh or feel uncomfortable. A few obessions of mine are soup dumplings, cats, history, dancing, podcasts, and reading. Preferably all accompanied with a bottle of champagne. I can't wait to marry my creep in crime!!

          One lonely day on <a href="http://crimefeed.com/2016/03/match-made-in-hell-five-online-dates-ending-in-murder/" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>, these two happened accross one another. The connection was instant, the jokes offensive, and they just couldn't stop chatting even though it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haOys7E2Zbo" target="_blank">D&D</a> night so Chris was in a rush. Six years, three cities, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/zyZP3XLvtn/" target="_blank">two cats</a> later they're finally getting hitched.
